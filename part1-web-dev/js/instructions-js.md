# JS: Getting Started #

*Background*

- JavaScript is 'the language of the web' for creating dynamic interfaces between you and the computer, your computer and other computers. More info [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- We are going to focus on manipulating the [Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) (DOM).

:dart: Link the html file to a js file and test the connection.

1. Make a script.js file in your folder. In it, write `console.log('hello')`
2. In index.html, link to your .js file inside the head `<script src="myScript.js"></script>
`
3. View your website in the browser, inspect element and check the console
4. You should see your message appear to show that your js file is connected
5. Once you have reached this stage, it is time to start investigating the resources below in order to progress to writing functions
