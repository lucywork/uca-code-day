# Ideas for Applied Art & Design #

### APIs and Data ###
[Any API](https://any-api.com/) has 1,400 public data sets you can use in your projects.

### Arduino & Raspberry Pi ###
- [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits) for prototyping circuits virtually
- [Ada Fruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) for tutorials and stock

### AR & VR ###
- Make a [cardboard headset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qNmRi-gNqE) (but remember it doesn't have to be a purely visual output).
- Use [FME's AR writer](https://www.safe.com/integrate/fme-augmented-reality-ar/) to show 3D models in an AR environment
- Further: see [Zizek's lecture on VR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnTQhIRcrno) - important to maintain critical perspective

### Projection Mapping ###
- See [projection-mapping.org](project-mapping.org/learn)
- Also [MapMap](https://mapmapteam.github.io/) â€“ for artists

### Internet of Things: QR Codes ###
[Generate a QR code](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/) and adapt according to design needs

### Chatbots and natural language processing ###
- Search for open source chatbot platforms.
- Invent your own non-technical, speculative prototypes based on Turing Test.

### General ###
- See [Experiments with Google](https://experiments.withgoogle.com) for latest creative innovations
- Consider current frontiers and debates in tech
