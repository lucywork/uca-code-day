# CSS: Instructions #

*Background info*
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users â€” how they are styled, laid out, etc. Source/Further reading [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works).

## A. Set up ##
1. In your folder, make a file called 'styles.css'
2. In your index.html file, add a link to your css file
3. How? Inside your head tags, add this line `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`

## B. How to select and edit elements ##
1. Let's change the navigation bar to silver
`nav {
  background-color: silver;
  }`
2. Save/refresh/view
3. Hmmm... what about the margin?
4. Can we add a style the whole body element to remove that margin?
5. Save/refresh/view

:speech_balloon:

## C. Specificity: id and class attributes ##
1. Let's select our image element by giving it a unique [id](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) in the html file.<em>
An id allows us to add custom styles to one unique html element (as opposed to all the images, in this case). See [class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class) to differentiate.</em>
2. Now we can create a css style that only effects that image, e.g. `#profile-pic {max-width: 25%;}`

:speech_balloon:

## D. Layout ##
- [CSS layout](http://learnlayout.com/toc.html) can be tricky at first. We probably won't have time to cover it today.
- Keep it [<i>responsive</i>](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/). Remember that your layout needs to work on mobile screens too.
---
1. Rather than allowing our content to travel to spread across the display from edge to edge, let's add a maximum width
2. You need to create a [div](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp) in the html file, nested within the body tags but excluding the nav and footer
3. Give your div the id 'container'
4. In your css file, make the #container max-width: 960px and the margin: 0 auto
5. Save, refresh, review
6. Now give your section elements a height of 80vh ([See CSS Units > Relative Lengths](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp))

:speech_balloon:

## E. Relative sizing ##
1. The contact form looks bunched up
2. Let's give its input fields a margin of [1em](https://css-tricks.com/confused-rem-em/) so they can breathe

## F. Main navigation menu ##
1. Now let's fix the navigation menu
2. How are you going to only style the list in the menu, and not the list in the portfolio/section 2?
3. Make the list-style: none
4. Now style the `nav ul li` element to make it [inline-block](http://learnlayout.com/inline-block-layout.html) so it lists horizontally


## G. Independent progress

:clap: Congrats! You made it through the CSS code-along!

- Now you have reached this stage, you can start to implement the following changes by researching solutions solo.
- Remember: Google has the answer to most web dev questions and even senior devs are used to researching answers online.

1. Change the default font to one you like
2. Edit the layout of each section (refer back to learnlayout.com or see [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/))
3. Add a favicon
4. Balance out the whitespace (look up: margin, border, padding)
5. Add a unicode copyright symbol in the footer
6. Implement a colour scheme using hex or RGB
7. Make the image into a circle (use border radius)
8. Give the image a border
9. [Make the menu items link](https://way2tutorial.com/html/html_internal_links.php) to the corresponding sections
10. Create a [photo gallery](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_portfolio_gallery.asp) instead or in addition to the portfolio
