## User Interface: Prototyping ##
- Do your [UX Research]() first (or sit in with a researcher) so you have a clear idea of what you need to achieve
- Pencil and paper
    - Use rapid prototyping techniques (e.g. 8 ideas in 8 minutes on 8 pages)
    - With pencil and paper, you don't get so attached to one design
    - Make sure you get feedback on layout with paper prototypes, e.g. ask a user where on the page would they click to find contact details
    - [5 users]() (from the right demographic) are usually enough to understand the main problems
- Black and white wireframes
    - Some designers may feel comfortable with illustrator
    - Personally, I use [SketchApp]() because its interface allows complexity, while only retaining the elements and [grid systems]() you need for responsive web design
- As early as possible, create prototypes that you can test with: build-measure-learn
    - You can import image files into [inVision]() to easily animate, creating the illusion of a functioning user interface
    - If you are fast with HTML and CSS, you can make your prototypes in code (few designers can)
- Make your creation shareable and the conversion into code streamlined
    - inVision provides shareable links
    - You can also use communication tools like the app [Zeplin]() so that developers (or you) can see how your design translates into HTML and CSS
- Manage your workflow
    - You can use an online [task manager]() (basically an organised to-do list with cool integrations)
    - In a team, you might use an open source project management (and hosting) platform, like [GitHub]()
- The research never stops
    - Your UX/UI role is not over once the website is published (if they are still paying you!)
    - Encourage analytics integrations such as [heatmapping and live recordings]() as well as statistics from [Google Analytics](), etc.
    - Monitoring user behaviour will allow you to see the design pitfalls (every product has them) and adapt, so you continue to build-measure-learn
    - Once you have a hypothesis about something that needs to change, you might have enough empirical evidence to guide your next move, or you might need to organise – to give a few examples – [A/B]() testing, [focus groups](), or [interviews]().
