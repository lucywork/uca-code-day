## User Interface: Prototyping ##
- Do your [UX Research](https://www.nngroup.com) first (or sit in with a researcher) so you have a clear idea of what you need to achieve
- Pencil and paper
    - Use rapid prototyping techniques (e.g. 8 ideas in 8 minutes on 8 pages)
    - With pencil and paper, you don't get so attached to one design
    - Make sure you get feedback on layout with paper prototypes (usability testing), e.g. ask a user where on the page would they click to find contact details
    - [5 users](www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users) (from the right demographic) are usually enough to understand the main problems
- Black and white wireframes
    - Some designers may feel comfortable with illustrator
    - Personally, I use [Sketch App](www.sketch.com) because its interface allows complexity, while only retaining the elements and [grid systems](www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-grid-system-building-a-solid-design-layout) you need for responsive web design
- As early as possible, create prototypes that you can test with: build-measure-learn
    - You can import image files into [inVision](www.invisionapp.com) to easily animate, creating the illusion of a functioning user interface
    - If you are fast with HTML and CSS, you can make your prototypes in code (few designers can)
- Make your creation shareable and the conversion into code streamlined
    - inVision provides shareable links
    - You can also use communication tools like the app [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io) so that developers (or you) can see how your design translates into HTML and CSS
- Manage your workflow
    - You can use an online task manager like [trello](www.trello.com) (basically an organised to-do list with cool integrations)
    - In a team, you might use an open source project management (and hosting) platform, like [GitHub](https://github.com)
- The research never stops
    - Your UX/UI role is not over once your design is published online
    - Encourage analytics integrations such as [heatmapping and live recordings](www.hotjar.com) as well as statistics from [Google Analytics](analytics.google.com), etc.
    - Monitoring user behaviour will allow you to see the design pitfalls (every product has them) and adapt, so you continue to build-measure-learn
    - Once you have a hypothesis about something that needs to change, you might have enough empirical evidence to guide your next move, or you might need to organise – to give a few examples – A/B testing, focus groups, interviews... even [eye-tracking](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/eye-tracking.html).
